# AVL_vs_Splay_Trees
This project compares the performance of avl and splay trees regarding 2 parameters: 
* Number of comparisons
* Number of rotations.

This is calculated by adding to a counter after each rotation and each comparison.
To make the file work simply write the following snippet into a terminal after copying the
repository.

```bash
./main.exe input.txt
```

You can edit the trees by changing the content of input.txt.

If you want to see the trees clone the printTreeVersion branch as it prints bothtrees and 
then shows you the result of the comparison. For more information you can read the documentation.
